    <h4>Guest Information</h4>
    <h5>Accommodations</h5>
    <p> For the adventuresome guest, camping is allowed at the Rigmore house!
    You are encouraged to bring your tent and sleeping bag and sleep out underneath the
    stars.  Those guest who live near by and do not feel comfortable driving home are also
    encouraged to camp. There is a huge grassy field and a fire pit, so there will be
    plenty of space to accommodate everyone wishing to camp. Bathrooms and showers are also
    available inside the Rigmore house.  </p>
