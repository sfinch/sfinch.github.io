    <h5>Accommodations</h5>
    <p> For the adventuresome guest, camping is allowed at the Rigmor House both
    Friday and Saturday nights!
    You are encouraged to bring your tent and sleeping bag and sleep out underneath the
    stars. Please let us know if you need camping supplies. There is a huge grassy field
    and a fire pit, so there
    will be plenty of space to accommodate everyone wishing to camp. Bathrooms and showers
    are available inside the Rigmor House, which will be open all night.  </p>

    Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, National, Payless, and Thrifty. </p>
