    <h4>Local activities</h4>
    The cites of Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill (the <i>Triangle</i>) are all within driving distance of the
    Hotel and Rigmor House.  Below is a short list of some of our recommended activities
    for those who are visiting the area. Most are located in downtown Durham, 15 minutes
    from the hotel and 30 minutes from the Rigmor House. 

    <h5> Restaurants </h5>
    Here is a list of our favorite restaurants. 
    North Carolina style BBQ will be served at the reception, so no BBQ restaurants are
    listed. 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.cookout.com">Cookout</a> $
          The ultimate NC fast food and late night dining experience awaits you. For under
          $5 you can get a cookout tray that comes with a burger, two sides, and a drink. A
          corn dog counts as a side. I repeat, A CORN DOG IS A SIDE. For 99 cents you can upgrade
          your drink to a milkshake, of which they have 38+ flavors. You can combine up to
          three flavors at no additional cost. </li>
        <li><a href="http://www.dameschickenwaffles.com">Dame's Chicken and Waffles</a> $$
          Southern comfort food. Waffles (classic, gingerbread, sweet potato, blueberry,
          or vegan) topped with crispy fried chicken and "shmears" (sweet crème
          butters). </li>
        <li><a href="http://lavaquitanc.com/">La Vaquita</a> $
          Authentic tacos. No indoor seating. </li>
        <li><a href="http://mateotapas.com">Mateo</a> $$ 
          A great tapas restaurant in downtown Durham that also features a large Spanish
          wine list as well as one of the largest sherry offerings in the country. </li>
        <li><a href="http://www.nanataco.com/">Nana Taco</a> $
          Fancy tacos. </li>
        <li><a href="http://www.shikinc.com/">Shiki Sushi</a> $
          While this is only our second favorite sushi restaurant in the area, it's still
          pretty darn good and is conveniently located 5 minutes from the hotel. </li>
        <li><a href="http://onlyburger.com">Only Burger</a> $
          The only burger you'll ever want. Try the Fried Green Tomato Burger
          (Heather's favorite). </li>
        <li><a href="http://www.pizzeriatoro.com">Pizzeria Toro</a> $$ 
          Wood fire pizza in downtown Durham. Although no reservations are taken and it's
          often crowded, this is easily the best pizza in the area. </li> 
        <li><a href="http://www.tylerstaproom.com/">Tyler's Taproom</a> $
          Get the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and an order of the Carolina Nachos. If you
          don't, you ordered wrong. The Durham location is in the trendy American Tobacco
          district, next to the Durham Bulls athletic park. There are also locations in Chapel
          Hill and Raleigh. The Chapel Hill location is 15 minutes from the Rigmor House
          and 10 minutes from the Hotel.</li>
      </ul>

    <h5> Breweries </h5>

          Breweries in Raleigh, NC. They give tours on the second Saturday of each month
